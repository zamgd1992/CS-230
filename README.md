
The Gaming Room wanted to expand their Android game Draw It or Lose It onto multiple platforms. 
This would be accomplished by developing a web-based version of the game that used the web to create an environment to allow other platforms to play the game.
A software design document is used to outline the requirements of the environment as well as make suggestions for the solution.

This document outlines the requirements of the software very well considering the needs of the client.
Using the template given to create the design document helped focus each part of the work.
It also created a place to organize the different parts of the design.
Using the design document helps focus on the needs of the client as well as plan the software.
Understanding the requirements of the software helped to decide to use a client-server-based pattern for the environment.

The part of the design document that I would like to revise is the comparison of the different platforms for the server.
This section needed more detail and ended up making the overall suggestion for the platform lack some of the reasoning for this choice. 

Ultimately the clientâ€™s needs are the most important thing to consider when looking into designing software because you are designing it for them.
In the case of The Gaming Room one of the biggest factors to consider when choosing a platform to run the environment was cost.
Another was looking at a system that would be able to handle the amount of traffic the game would have.

Learning design patterns that can be used to develop software was a key part of the design for this project.
Finding a pattern that may work and thinking through how that can be utilized was a good way to find a viable solution. 
It is important to be able to not only see a pattern that would work but interpreting that pattern and making it work for the current problem.
